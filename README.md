## üìê Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](Architecture%20Diagram.png)

### Key Features:
- **Multi‚ÄëAZ deployment across two Availability Zones (AZs)** ensures fault tolerance and high availability.
- **Three-tier architecture**: Presentation (frontend), Application (backend), Data (database).
- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)** with **Launch Templates** ensure elasticity and responsiveness to changing load.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** routes HTTPS traffic securely and balances load across healthy instances.
- **Amazon RDS MySQL Multi‚ÄëAZ** provides resilient, highly available data persistence.
- **CloudWatch Logs and Alarms** ensure monitoring and observability at every layer.

## üîπ Detailed Components

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **VPC and Networking**
- Custom **VPC spanning two AZs** with:
  - **Public subnets**: Bastion Hosts and ALB.
  - **Private subnets**: Application/Presentation EC2 instances and RDS MySQL.
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)** for public subnet outbound/inbound traffic.
- **NAT Gateways in each AZ**: Allow secure outbound access for private subnet instances.
- **Route Tables**:
  - Public subnet ‚Üí IGW.
  - Private subnet ‚Üí NAT Gateway.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **DNS and TLS**
- **Amazon Route 53** provides DNS resolution for custom domains.
- **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** issues and manages SSL certificates for HTTPS.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Security**
- **Security Groups (SGs)**:
  - ALB SG: Inbound HTTPS (443) from any IP.
  - EC2 SGs: Accept traffic only from ALB or Bastion as appropriate.
  - RDS SG: Allows traffic only from Application Tier EC2 SG.
  - Bastion Host SG: SSH restricted to trusted IP ranges.
- **IAM Roles**:
  - **EC2 Instance Profile**: Enables CodeDeploy agent and CloudWatch Logs access.
  - **CodePipeline Role**: Orchestrates build/deploy workflow.
  - **CodeBuild Role**: S3 read/write and CloudWatch Logs.
  - **CodeDeploy Role**: EC2 deploy permissions.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Bastion Host and Secure Administration**
- Bastion Hosts deployed in public subnet for restricted admin access.
- Used for securely accessing private resources such as EC2 and RDS for management.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Full‚ÄëStack Application

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Presentation Tier**
- **ReactJS Single Page Application (SPA)**.
- Served via **NGINX on EC2 instances in private subnets**.
- Traffic routed through ALB + CloudFront for performance and security.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Application Tier**
- **Node.js API backend** providing business logic.
- **PM2** ensures uptime, auto‚Äërestart, and centralized logging.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Tier**
- **Amazon RDS MySQL Multi-AZ**:
  - Automatic failover from primary to standby during AZ disruption.
  - Encryption at rest and in transit.
  - Private-only access from Application Tier EC2 instances.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

![CI/CD Pipeline Flow](CICD%20Pipeline%20Flow.png)

### App Tier CI/CD:
- **CodeBuild for App Tier**:
  - Installs dependencies, runs tests, builds backend artifacts.
  - Stores build artifacts in S3.
- **CodeDeploy for App Tier**:
  - Zero-downtime deployment to App Tier EC2 instances.
- **CodePipeline for App Tier**:
  - GitHub ‚Üí CodeBuild ‚Üí CodeDeploy.

### Presentation Tier CI/CD:
- **CodeBuild for Presentation Tier**:
  - `npm install` and `npm run build` for React frontend.
  - Uploads artifacts to S3.
- **CodeDeploy for Presentation Tier**:
  - Deploys built static assets and NGINX config to Presentation Tier EC2.
- **CodePipeline for Presentation Tier**:
  - Fully automated end-to-end workflow.

---

## üîî Monitoring, Logging, Elasticity

- **CloudWatch Logs**:
  - Centralized logs for:
    - NGINX server logs.
    - Node.js application logs.
    - System logs for all EC2 instances.
  - Enables diagnostics, observability, and operational excellence.

- **CloudWatch Alarms**:
  - CPU utilization monitoring.
  - Triggering ASG scale-out and scale-in policies automatically.

- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**:
  - Launches instances using Launch Templates.
  - Automatically registers instances with ALB Target Groups.
  - Ensures horizontal scalability and resilience.

---

## üì¶ S3 Buckets and Artifact Management

- Used for:
  - Storing build artifacts from CodeBuild.
  - Temporary storage of deployment assets for CodeDeploy.

---

## üåê CloudFront Distribution

- **Amazon CloudFront**:
  - Global content distribution network (CDN).
  - Edge caching for static content.
  - Integrated with ALB for dynamic content delivery.
  - SSL termination at edge locations for performance and security.

---

## üß™ Testing and Validation

End-to-end system testing included:
- DNS and HTTPS resolution.
- Load testing for scaling behavior.
- Simulated AZ failure scenarios.
- Verified CI/CD automation pipelines.
- Validated secure RDS connectivity from private subnets.
